Now that we've got our ducks -ahem zombies- in row,
 let's move forward to the next phase... 🧟🦆‍🧟🦆🧟🦆‍🧟🦆🧟🦆‍🧟🦆

 2. Act
We've reached the part where we're going to be calling the function that creates a new zombie for Alice- createRandomZombie.

But there's a slight problem- how can we make it so the method "knows" who calls it? Another way to put it would be- how can we make sure Alice (and not Bob) is going to be the owner of this new zombie?🧐

Well... the problem is solved with the contract abstraction. One of the features of Truffle is that it wraps the original Solidity implementation and lets us specify the address that makes the function call by passing that address as an argument.

The following calls createRandomZombie and makes sure msg.sender is set to Alice's address:

`const result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[0], {from: alice});`
Now I have a quick question for you: do you know what gets stored in result?

Well, let me explain.


Once we specified the contract we wanted to test using artifacts.require, Truffle automatically provides the logs generated by our smart contract. What this means is that we can now retrieve the name of Alice's newly created zombie using something like this: result.logs[0].args.name. In a similar fashion, we can get the id and the _dna.

Besides these bits of information, result is going to be giving us several other useful details about the transaction:

- result.tx: the transaction hash
- result.receipt: an object containing the transaction receipt. If result.receipt.status is equal to true it means that the transaction was successful. Otherwise, it means that the transaction failed.


> Note that logs can also be used as a much cheaper option to store data. The downside is that they can't be accessed from within the smart contract itself.


```java
const CryptoZombies = artifacts.require("CryptoZombies");
const zombieNames = ["Zombie 1", "Zombie 2"];
contract("CryptoZombies", (accounts) => {
    let [alice, bob] = accounts;
    it("should be able to create a new zombie", async () => {
        const contractInstance = await CryptoZombies.new();
        // start here
        const result = await contractInstance.createRandomZombie(zombieNames[0], {from: alice});
        assert.equal(result.receipt.status,true);
        assert.equal(result.logs[0].args.name,zombieNames[0]);
    })
})

```
